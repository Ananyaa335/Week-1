# Week-1
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically identify and classify images of waste into 12 different material categories (e.g., Plastic, Metal, Paper, E-waste, Organic).  The key is implementing Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning on a pre-trained model.

Sustainability Relevance:
Problem Addressed: Inefficient waste sorting leads to high landfill contamination, increased processing costs, and lower recycling rates. Solution: By automating the classification process, the system can dramatically improve the purity of recycling streams, making the recycling process more economically viable and environmentally effective. The focus on detailed classes like differentiating battery waste or PCB e-waste.Thus it addresses modern, complex waste challenges.
